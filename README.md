# LibraryApp

# React
#### is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, it is used to create interactive web applications. React relies on reusable components and efficiently manages state, making it easier to develop dynamic applications.4
In this task, we created a Library Management App using React. We started by setting up a new repository and React app using the npx create-react-app command. We then defined an initial state containing book data and created components like Header, Main, and Footer. In the Main component, we displayed the list of books using a card layout to show details like the title, author, and ISBN number.
